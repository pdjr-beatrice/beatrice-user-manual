    <para>Johan was enjoying himself hugely. If he had been the sort of man to
    reflect on life then it would have come as a surprise to him that he was
    so pleasurably engrossed in his courtship of Paulina Maria.But he was not
    that sort of man so did not waste a second on such thoughts. Instead, he
    relished the feeling of exhilaration that was so reminiscent of those
    times at sea when the ship creamed along with full sails on a running sea
    and it was his hands that were on the wheel.</para>

    <para>He had been a reluctant suitor at first, already set in his bachelor
    ways at the age of twenty eight. Aware of the firm hands of both families
    setting him on his present course, the rebeliousness of his independent
    spirit had been on a collision course with their control until the warm
    winds of flattery swelled his ego and he came about. Understanding that he
    was deemed worthy to have his name associated with that of Marcellus
    Bisdom van Vliet, a man whose good name in trade was known the all along
    The Great Rivers and whose wealth and political stature was recognised
    throughout Holland, puffed up his pride by association.</para>

    <para>Yet there was something more to this change of tack in his courtship
    of Paulina Maria than could be accounted for by mere flattery. Something
    in her response to his attentions spoke directly to a need deep within
    him, although he was not consciously aware of what this was. He had begun
    by simply going through the social motions of courtship, but Paulina Maria
    had been so receptive, so open and so guileless in her reception of him
    that he had been quite won over by her. Her obvious delight at everything
    he said and did drew him to her in anticipation of an unbounded and
    uncritical love such as he had not experienced he was since a boy at his
    mother's knee. That first feeling of being loved so completely had ended
    abruptly upon the birth of his sickly younger brother who survived to
    distract their mother with the burden of his care, then the untimely death
    of his father which left her an impoverished widow. Johan the child basked
    in the glow of Paulina Maria's adoration.</para>

    <para>He had known a lot of women since entering the Marine as a youth but
    the pleasures of their company had rarely left any lasting impression on
    him and it was only the ease of a woman's virtue that had ever drawn him
    back to her. Indeed, one of the more pleasant aspects of his residence at
    the Hotel De Zalm was the sweet and available maid-of-all-work who was
    willing to help him unmake his bed in return for the small change he left
    on the dresser. But nothing had ever recaptured for him that lamented lost
    feeling of being loved and wanted without qualification or demands. Until
    now, that is, and with this most unlikely of women who held no more sexual
    attraction for him that which came simply by virtue of her wearing a
    gown.</para>

    <para>Again, if he had been a man to ponder such things, Johan would have
    been amazed at himself for the longing he felt for Paulina Maria's
    company. Such was the soothing quality of his time spent with her that,
    had he been able to name the emotion felt upon parting from her, he would
    have called it grief. Paulina never left him to suffer the agony of loss
    for long, however, as she sent him a continuous stream of long letters to
    which he eagerly responded. He often enclosed a new photograph of himself
    in his uniform as he knew these pleased her, eliciting favourable comments
    in her next correspondence.</para>

    <para>Now he was to spend several days in her company at the Bisdom van
    Vliet house in Haastrecht. He arrived on the first Thursday in August to
    find that Marcellus was away from home and not expected back until dinner
    time the next day. Maria Elizabeth was, as usual, much taken up with the
    affairs of the family's local properties and village interests. Paulina
    Maria normally helped her mother with these tasks but had been released
    from most of her duties in order to entertain their guest. The only call
    on her time was the management of the household during Johan's visit,
    which she said it was her pleasure to perform.</para>

    <para>The weather was good he spent spent several happy hours with Paulina
    Maria on his arm as they wandered through the
    <emphasis>overtuin</emphasis> across the lane from the house. They admired
    the new planting which had been done, held imaginary conversations with
    the statues of Hercules and Neptune, fancied themselves explorers
    discovering the grotto on its island, then paused to look at their
    reflections in the lake and admire the view over the farms to the
    windmills along the Vlist. Turning back towards the house, they peeped in
    at the house plants being propagated in orangerie but found it much to hot
    and steamy to linger there for long.</para>

    <para>They cooled down by taking cordials with Oma under the shade of the
    old copper beech tree in the formal garden behind the house. The old lady,
    now in her eighty-fourth year, had developed a tremour and Johan Jacob
    watched tenderly as Paulina Maria helped the old lady to drink from her
    cup without spills. Despite this physical sign of her advanced age, Oma
    seemed keen to show an interest in him and soon got him telling stories
    about his naval exploits. When the couple rose to leave Oma took advantage
    the social <emphasis>largesse</emphasis> granted to those of advanced
    years when delivering him of her parting shot,</para>

    <para>"Now don't leave it too long, will you? We need children to keep the
    family going!"</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title></title>

    <para>As he lay alone in the old-fashioned cupboard bed in his room in the
    <emphasis>familiehuis</emphasis>, old Oma's words popped back into Johan's
    head. Up to this point in his life he had only been dimly aware of the
    connection between coutship and marriage, having taken more notice of
    scandalous relationships than the more conventional ones. His courtship of
    Paulina Maria seemed to be a thing in and of itself its destination lost
    on the hazy horizon of the future. Suddenly the sun shone through and he
    saw with crystal clarity that he was meant to marry her and father her
    children.</para>

    <para>Gilles had laid out for him clearly the progression from first
    meetings to formal application to court followed by the courtship itself
    leading to the making of an offer of marriage. The actual goal of being
    married had, however, remained vague for him. Johan understood that a
    wedding marked the transition from the groom being an unattached batchelor
    to being a husband bound to one woman for life. Perhaps Gilles had rashly
    assumed that his brother comprehended the state of matrimony as well as he
    did, especially as he was a frequent visitor to Gilles and Maria's home,
    and that it required no further elaboration concerning the duties and
    obligations involved.</para>

    <para>Without a trace of hesitation or doubt at the prospect of a
    permanent liason with Paulina Maria, Johan Jacob decided that, yes, he
    could live with the way she made him feel! More than that, he could no
    longer contemplate life without her, the very thought of which now made
    him feel rather panic-stricken. His certainty about her feelings for him
    suddenly began to ebb away laying bare the reefs of his insecurity. He
    snuggled down into a nest of soft mattress, feather pillows and voluminous
    covers in order to comfort himself. He should ask for her hand soon,
    before she had time to cool towards him. Yes, that is what he must
    do!</para>

    <para>Having resolved on taking this course, Johan Jacob's thoughts moved
    on to the topic of children. The connection between sex and unwanted
    pregnancy, not to mention certain unmentionable diseases, had long been
    familiar to him. The link between marriage, sex and the inevitability of
    children was something new for him to contemplate. Now he began to toss
    around the notion of sex for procreation rather than for pleasure and
    relief.</para>

    <para>He wondered what it would be like having conjugal relations with
    Paulina Maria. It was difficult for him to think of her in that way but
    Oma had made it clear for him that he was to stand stallion for the Bisdom
    van Vliet blood line. He exercised his libidinous faculties in trying to
    conjour up an image of what lay beneath Paulina Maria's petticoats. He
    anticipated the feel of her naked breasts under his hands. They were just
    as he liked breasts to be, large yet firm.</para>

    <para>He found that his member was stiffening as his imaginings shifted to
    the warm, moist cleft between her legs which welcomed him inside. Now
    thoroughly aroused, he had no other recourse than to seek the seaman's
    release. Waking sometime later he climbed down from his bed, put on his
    dressing gown and slippers then went in search of the night servant to ask
    for some brandy and a cigar to be brought to him.</para>

    <para>Settling into an arm chair that was set before the open shutters and
    window of his room, Johan tried again to focus his thoughts on marriage
    and paternity cooled by the night air. He might have reflected upon the
    suffering he witnessed as his parents buried yet another small coffin in
    the Oude Tonge churchyard. Or recalled the distress of his brother,
    Gilles, who could only wait and listen as Maria screamed for a whole night
    and the following day bringing his namesake into the world. Or brought to
    mind the young life of his vibrant cousin, Elisabeth, cut short by
    childbirth. But he reflected on none of these sad events, neither did his
    lips form a smile at remembrance of the joy children brought to the
    world.</para>

    <para>What actually came to mind was the comforting thought of how little
    the arrival of young Johan Jacob had altered Gillis's daily life. He was
    still able to go about his affairs and travel from home without hindrance.
    His prospective father-in-law was also a re-assuring case in point, being
    hardly ever at home, or so it seemed. Johan would have been loathe to
    curtail his activities for the sake of any child he might father, finding
    it difficult to rest in any one place for long. His resolve to marry
    Paulina Maria would soon have melted away had he felt his freedom of
    movement in any way threatened.</para>

    <para>Johan was thus able to re-assure himself that he was not about to
    give up his liberty in any real sense but, rather, was about to gain a
    secure emotional future whilst placing himself in an advantageous social
    position into the bargain. Now becoming fuddled with alcohol and
    tiredness, he burrowed back into the surprisingly comfortable old bed and
    was soon snoring fit to raise the roof.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title></title>

    <para>The following day dawned fine and warm, offering Johan the prospect
    of again spending much of it out of doors, as was his preference. He
    missed being on the deck of a ship, if not the discipline of life at sea.
    The day was especially full of promise as he was to have Paulina Maria to
    himself for several hours before they would be obliged to join her parents
    and Oma for a family meal. Paulina Maria had appeared at breakfast wearing
    a light gown that showed rather more of her enticingly ample bossom than
    was her usual habit, a choice of dress which he could not help but
    interpret as being entirely for his benefit.</para>

    <para>Once their coffee and bread had been taken, Paulina Maria announced
    that she wanted hime to accompany her to the stables in order to inspect
    the new carriage horse that had been her birthday gift from her parents.
    She suggested that afterwards they might have the horse harnessed to the
    <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> and take a drive along the dyke-top to the
    village of Willige Langerak on the banks of the River Lek. It soon became
    clear to him that horses and horse-drawn transport was a keen interest of
    hers, but one that he did not share.</para>

    <para>Perhaps conditioned by his father's ill-humoured old nag, Johan had
    grown up distrustful of horses, finding them alarmingly large, powerful
    and unpredictable. The movement of their gangling legs made his feet ache
    at the very thought of them getting caught between iron-shod hoof and hard
    earth. Their strong jaws and massive teeth threatened to wreak havoc with
    his flesh as their long necks seemed able to rotate their huge heads in
    every conceivable direction, offering little hope of escape. Their bulging
    eyes seemed to follow his every move with nothing but evil intent in them,
    especially when the whites showed. Altogether, he regarded the horse as a
    beast of wilful malevolence which he could not believe capable of human
    subjugation and was thankful that they had no place at sea.</para>

    <para>With Paulina Maria on his arm, Johan found himself propelled towards
    the stables at a pace which brooked no hesitation. Fortunately for the
    course of his courtship, his equine anxieties soon evaporated under the
    heat from the distraction created by the motion of Paulina Maria's breasts
    which were thrust upwards by her corset and barely concealed by the cut of
    her dress and the flimsiness of its fabric. Not only could he snatch
    surreptitious glimpses of her magnificent <emphasis>decoletage</emphasis>
    but he could also relish the sensation of an ocassional brush of clothed
    breast against his upper arm, not to mention the feel of a sturdy thigh
    against his through the thickness of her skirts as she strode along beside
    him. All in all he found himself rendered incapable of uttering anything
    coherent, let alone negative, on the subject of horses, being so
    distracted that he could barely follow the thread of her bright chatter.
    In his not trivial experience of women he had learnt that they were all
    too aware of the physical signals they were sending through these slight
    contacts and glimpses of exposed flesh. To his delight, Johan took Paulina
    Maria to be flirting with him sexually!</para>

    <para>Once they had arrived at the stables Paulina Maria bade the head
    ostler lead out her new horse. Emerging from the gloom of her stall, the
    animal started at the brightness of the external world causing Johan's
    heart to begin to pound. The ostler soon calmed the mare with soft words
    and a gentle hand then began to lead her up and down the yard for the
    admiration of her visitors. The animal's coat gleamed in the sunshine,
    emphasising the toned muscles that underlay her supple movements. The
    delicate way in which she placed her feet and her responsiveness to the
    lightest touch from the ostler began to entrance Johan. A tatoo beat out
    from the man's clogs and the beast's iron shoes striking the cobbled
    ground as the mare was was put through her paces: walking, turning,
    trotting and turning to walk past them again. Johan began to be mesmerised
    by the sounds, by the oneness of man and mare, and by the sheer beauty and
    grace of the animal.</para>

    <para>Finally the ostler brought the horse to a halt before them making
    her stand so as to be presented to best advantage for their inspection.
    Following Paulina Maria's lead, Johan ran his hand along the mare's neck,
    thrilling to the feel of her firm muscles beneath the warm, velvet of her
    coat. He was given carrot and apple peices to hold out on the palm of his
    hand for the mare to take. Her breath was warm on his skin as her soft
    lips delicately felt for the food before gently lifting it from him with a
    watchmaker's precision. He found himself fascinated by the fine skin of
    her muzzle, almost hairless but for a few long whiskers, by the mobile
    nostrils that softly inhaled and exhaled, and by her unfocussed brown eyes
    which suggested nothing so much as a benign character. Unable to resist
    exploring her face further, he ran his hand over her forehead, ears, and
    mane before the ostler's discrete cough broke the mare's spell.</para>

    <para>As the horse was led away to be put into harness, Johan turned to
    Paulina Maria and offered her his arm for the return walk to the house. He
    found her gazing into his eyes and smiling contentedly. His heart filled
    with such joy that he could barely stop himself from acting without
    decorum, to shout, to laughing loudly and to catch Paulina Maria up by the
    waste and run with her. Self-control was necessary as their path crossed
    with that of three servants traveling in an open cart with whom greetings
    and cheery waves were exchanged. Paulina Maria explained that a picnic was
    being sent on ahead and would be laid out ready for them to take lunch
    when they got to her father's<emphasis>
    jac</emphasis><emphasis>hthuis</emphasis> in Willige Langerak. What a
    miracle of organisation she was, thinking of everything and arranging it
    just so! He must have her as his wife!</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title></title>

    <para>Johan's high spirits were soon to be deflated, however. Having
    prepared themselves for their drive out, Paulina Maria now sporting a
    different and more decorous outfit to suit the activity, they waited in
    the vestibule for their transport to be brought to them. A clearly
    expensive and very ornately decorated <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> appeared
    with a uniformed groom leading the magnificent mare who was now between
    its delicate shafts. Johan found himself fervently hoping that he would
    not be required to take the driving seat. He could see that the light,
    two-seater carriage had no box for a coachman nor was their any
    possibility of a postilion to ride the lead horse of a pair. He could
    barely sit a horse much less drive one so the prospect of being put in
    charge of such a refined and costly rig as that drawing up before him
    filled him with horror. Would Paulina Maria consider it unmanly of him
    were he to decline to take the reins? If he were to conceal his
    shortcomings behind an exhibition of bravado in the driving seat could he
    avoid the shame of discovery? Images of every sort of carriage accident
    known to him crowded in front of his mind's eye. A paralysis siezed him
    such as he had never known even in the worst of conditiond at sea.</para>

    <para>It was, then, a not inconsiderable measure of relief that Johan saw
    realised that Paulina Maria was heading determinedly for the left seat in
    the <emphasis>sjees</emphasis>. Hastily mastering himself, Johan helped
    her up into the carriage then walked round to the right side and climbed
    in himself. Once they were settled, sitting close together as dictated by
    the lack of space in the carriage, Paulina Maria signalled to the man at
    the horse's head that they were to set off. Soon they were on their way
    through the village and the Vlisterdijk road towards Shoonhoven, neither
    of them driving although the long driving reins were tied up conveniently
    close to Paulina Maria's left hand. It was only as they got underway that
    she explained the rather unconventional seating arrangement as only
    prudent with a relatively untried horse which had never pulled a
    <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> before or been driven by anyone in the
    household apart from her father. She wished to spare Johan the
    responsibility of driving in these circumstances and hoped that he would
    not be offended. He was not, he assured her, managing to present a
    graceful acceptance of her decision which avoided a confession of his
    shortcoming as a suitor.</para>

    <para>As they passed slowly and sedately along the Hoogstraat, the men
    they passed doffed their hats and women dipped little curtsies. Johan was
    unaware of it but their route out of the village carefully avoided the
    poorer dwellings to the east of the Grote Haven, instead passing only the
    best houses and the thriving businesses. Once out in the countryside,
    Johan remarked on the large number of windmills, he counted eight, they
    could see along the river Vlist. Although the land below the dijk seemed
    still quite waterlogged, despite the recent dry spell, and a reasonable
    breeze none of the mills was turning. Paulina Maria explained that one of
    the other duties of the servants in the cart ahead of them had been to ask
    the millers to stop their sails until their <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> had
    passed. The Gouda to Schoonhoven Post Coach had also been held back to let
    them go on ahead of it as well as any vagrants or beggars cleared out of
    their path.</para>

    <para>The way having been prepared for them, the journey passed most
    pleasantly. Johan had all the mills and farms named for him and anecdotes
    told about the local characters who inhabited them. It soon became clear
    to him that Paulina Maria and her mother not only controlled all that he
    could see with a firm business hand, they also took an interest in the
    lives of their tenants. Families suffering sickness and hardship received
    assistance so that none should be destitute through no fault of their own.
    Although Paulina Maria did not talk about this, he soon deduced for
    himself how delicate the balance between water, wind and land was. As high
    tides and heavy rainfall raised water levels in the River Vlist, which ran
    between the larger rivers of the Ijssel and Lek so drawing water from both
    of them, the land would flood. If the wind to turn the mills did not come
    then it would not be possible to pump the water off the land so it would
    remain waterlogged. Being at the mercy of wind and water was something he
    could understand and came as a welcome antidote to the earlier social
    shortcomings he had felt.</para>

    <para>Progress towards their destination was slow, being restricted to the
    best walking pace of the groom. His equilibrium restored, Johan now took
    advantage of their close physical proximity and the time on their hands to
    pay attention to his courtship of Paulina Maria. He began with usual
    compliments on appearance: the colour of her carriage dress bringing out
    the colour of her eyes, the attraction of the healthy blush of her
    complexion, the inviting shape and colour of her lips, and so on. He leant
    close to her and spoke softly, seductively on the pretense of privacy from
    the ears of the groom. He leant close to her and vetured to take her hand
    under the cover of her voluminous skirt. He toyed with slipping his arm a
    round her waist, which would allow him to explore the corsetry beneath her
    dress for its hints about the flesh beneath. She seemed to accept his
    attentions with some warmth yet she did not respond physically as he had
    thought she might, so he held back from pressing her too far for fear of
    rejection.</para>

    <para>Passing what seemed to be the last mill before coming to a village,
    Johan rallied his interest as Paulina Maria told him about it. His
    attentiveness was part courtship ploy as well as a half genuine enquiry
    and turned out to be successful on both counts as the mill's long history
    was recounted with some enthusiasm. The current Bonrepasmolen, he was
    told, was the latest to be built on the site of the earliest mill in South
    Holland, with a collapsing bridge and loss of wind dogging the one attempt
    made to re-locate the mill to the opposite side of the Vlist. Hearing them
    approaching, Miller Prins came out of the reed-thatched pyramid of a house
    that he and his family occupied beneath the wooden cap of the mill and
    proudly held up his baby son, Arie, for the lady and her guest to admire.
    Calling for the <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> to be halted briefly, Paulina
    Maria produced a coin from some concealed place in her skirts and
    instructed the groom to pass it to the miller then continue with their
    journey. Leaning conspiratorially towards Johan, she quietly explained
    that she wished to discourage Miller Prins from presenting the child at
    the house since he was unlikely to resist using the occasion as an excuse
    to petition her mother and herself for money to enlarge the mill's house
    to accomodate his growing family. It was the view of her parents that the
    miller was lucky to have work and a home so should be grateful not greedy.
    Lacking any grounds to contradict her, Johan joined the whispered
    conspiracy against the miller.</para>

    <para>Their destination was soon in view as the Vlist swung round to leave
    the village of Willige Langerak on their right. Leaving the dijk, they
    turned to pass beside the church before taking the narrow lane to their
    left. The <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> was led up to the door of a long, low
    house from which an elderly man appeared, followed by the three Haastrecht
    servants, all four lining up to welcome them. Johan was glad to step down
    from the carriage and hastened to assist Paulina Maria down. Although the
    carriage was extremely well sprung and deeply upholstered he was relieved
    to be able to stretch his legs. Paulina Maria introduced the old man as
    Jan de Gier who acted as caretaker of the Jachthuis then invited Johan to
    enter the house with her. Once inside Paulina Maria disappeared into a
    distant room along with her maid and he was shown to his own room where he
    could make himself comfortable and clean after the dusty journey.</para>

    <para>As the Bisdom van Vliet family gathered before dinner on Friday 6th
    August Johan was pleased to announce that he and Paulina Maria were to be
    married as soon as everything could be put in place. Her family were
    delighted although the women were at first somewhat perturbed that there
    was to be no period of engagement. Then Marcellus voiced the view that the
    couple were old enough to know their own minds and any undue delay would
    serve no useful purpose - a view no doubt boulstered by his buisinesslike
    approach to his own wedding. Soon all concerns were put aside and a toast
    made to the betrothed pair.</para>

    <para>The discussion during the meal concluded with an almost military
    plan of action having been drawn up.Throughout that evening and the
    following day messengers came and went and the house bustled with constant
    activity and buzzed with hasty consulatations. Johan Jacob's only
    opportunity to feel his feet cooling was when he was once more alone in
    his cupboard bed. Actually, he soon fell asleep in the warm glow of his
    wholehearted acceptance by Paulina Maria and her family.</para>
