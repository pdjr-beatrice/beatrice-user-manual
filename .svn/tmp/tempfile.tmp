    <para>The curator adjusted the head torch then began warming the short,
    thin-bladed knife over the spirit burner which was placed diagonally
    across the table. Satisfied that the sliver of steel was warm enough to do
    its job yet not so hot as to cause melting, she carefully worked it
    between the embossed disk of dark red wax and the paper beneath it. The
    seal had also been applied on top of a silk cord from which it took some
    careful working of the blade to remove. The seal came away intact to be
    laid aside with a frisson of relief that no damage had been done during
    its removal. Her mission was to reveal the contents of the artefact with a
    view to re-assembling the parts into the exact form in which the whole had
    been created over a century earlier. This was no easy task since the
    packet, which was about the size of modern paperback, had been thoroughly
    secured so as to evidence even the slightest attempt at tampering.</para>

    <para>A second seal was slowly and painstakingly removed, allowing the
    length of silk cord which had parcelled up the packet to be gently eased
    off. The cord, still dutifully trying to hold its shape, had been placed
    to the left of the table. Soon all of the five seals that had been applied
    to the the enveloping sheet of paper had been removed and set down beside
    the cord. The time had come to open the outer wrapper and take the first
    glimpse of what lay beneath.</para>

    <para>The packet had spent the night in a sealed box with the vapours of a
    seven parts alcohol to one part water mixture. This should have worked on
    the white glue, which owed its adhesive properties to the protein colloid
    processed from the bones of animals and fish, degrading it so as to allow
    the top triangle of fine wove paper to be lifted easily. It was not to be,
    however, and the edges of the flap had to be delicately dabbed with a
    small sponge held by tweezers and dampened with some of the alcohol and
    water mix that had been warmed a little. Perhaps impatience got the better
    of the curator as she took up the slender knife once more for her first
    attempt at working the knife beneath the flap caused the blade to snag,
    almost tearing the paper.</para>

    <para>The gathering of museum friends drew in their breath as one. Each
    now became suddenly self-conscious, their rapt attention broken, and they
    began exchanging meaningful looks. For all that they were keeping a
    discrete distance and a reverend hush, their presence had now intruded and
    broken the curator's concentration. She leant back in her chair, removed
    the irksome head torch and massaged her forehead. Accustomed to the
    intense torchlight, the candlelit room now seemed dim. Perhaps this was
    just as well as it helped to maintain a professional distance from the
    audience.</para>

    <para>The meticulous preparations for tonight's event had begun some hours
    earlier. A blanket was spread over the polished wood of the dinning room
    table then covered with a clean, white, cotton cloth. A single,
    leather-covered, straight-backed chair was placed behind the table with
    its back to the huge dining room window. Everything that could conceivably
    be needed was arranged on the cloth so as to all be within easy reach from
    the chair. Next, the ornate double doors into the grand salon were slid
    open so that the two dozen or so invited guests could be accommodated
    between the two rooms without needing to crowd round the table.</para>

    <para>It was now midsummer dark outside but inside a romantic tallow glow
    belied the long process of lighting all the candles of the many candelabra
    in the hall, reception room, grand salon and dining room. The heavy, blue
    velvet curtains at the windows facing onto the road which passes between
    the front of the house and the park beyond had been closed. As had the
    huge shutters at windows to the rear of the house, excluding their view of
    the old, formal garden with its ancient copper beech and the waters of the
    Hollandse IJssel beyond. Finally, the curator had gone to the vapour box
    and carefully removed the treasured packet, borne it through the house and
    laid on the table with great reverence.</para>

    <para>A sober-suited lawyer had brought the packet from the safe at the
    museum's trustees premises in Rotterdam. The trustees had been most
    reluctant to agree to the packet's removal from their purview but the
    curator had stood her ground until they relented. The museum was the house
    where the artifact had been produced and was where it's contents should be
    revealed. It had come home, so to speak, to be properly cared for rather
    than pawed at by soulless money-men. The trustees had not capitulated
    totally, imposing the condition that their lawyer remain present
    throughout proceedings, even keeping a night vigil beside the vapour
    box.</para>

    <para>The curator gathered her wandering thoughts, replaced the head torch
    and returned her attention to the packet The guests quietened down in
    response to the renewed activity as at the flap recommenced, this time
    with more allowance being made for the vapours to soak into the
    old-fashioned glue. Timing was of the essence as letting the fine wove
    paper become wet to the point of soggy would also court disaster. But, at
    last, the flap permitted itself to be prised open.</para>

    <para>Now the moment had arrived for the packet to be opened and the cache
    of documents that it had concealed since 1922 released into the light. It
    would have brought a touch of magic to the proceedings had it been
    [possible to withdraw the papers one by one for display. However, the
    thoroughness of their authoress thwarted this performance with an
    encircling girdle of fine, pink, silk ribbon intended to maintain the
    neatness of her precious bundle. Thus a further delay was occasioned by
    the careful removal of the intact bundle from its outer clothing, followed
    by the teasing apart of another knot and the laying aside of paper and
    ribbon.</para>

    <para>One hundred years of close confinement had trained the documents to
    stay in their allotted places despite the removal their restraints. The
    curator could not resist giving in to the impulse to theatricality as she
    made a play of clothing her hands in a pair of fine, white cotton gloves,
    slowly smoothing each finger into its sheath. Only when the protective
    gloves were situated to her complete satisfaction was the top paper
    separated from the rest of the pile. She faltered now, being a child of
    the age of digital type which is unaccustomed to reading handwritten
    material. It added to the challenge that the text was in the shaky hand of
    an octogenarian woman given to idiosyncratic abbreviations and used an
    antiquated form of the Dutch language. So, it was a halting but
    contemporary rendition of the letter which was read out loud for the
    benefit of those present:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <attribution>Weduwe Bisdom van Vliet, 21e december 1922</attribution>

      <para>To the people of Haastrecht, My last will and testament, which was
      signed and witnessed this day, bequeaths my house and sufficient of my
      estates to support its upkeep in trust for you, the people of
      Haastrecht, on condition that nothing in the house is changed. When you
      read this letter then one hundred years will have passed since my death
      and the execution of my will must have secured the physical legacy of
      the Bisdom van Vliet family. So, I will now address another aspect of
      the Bisdom van Vliet legacy that I am anxious should be
      preserved.</para>

      <para>It is said that a person is not truly lost to the living whilst
      they are still spoken of. I believe this to be true. Since I am the last
      Bisdom van Vliet it falls to me to pass on the human legacy of my family
      through other means than the blood line. The notes, letters and diary
      pages enclosed in this packet have been carefully selected by me in
      order to reveal something of the true characters and private lives of
      the individuals involved. By waiting for a century to pass before
      revealing my story I can be sure that none of those mentioned will
      neither feel any hurt nor be tempted to arrogance by what is contained
      herein.</para>

      <para>I have witnessed many changes during my long life and wish to
      acknowledge that, a century after my passing, much will again be altered
      from the world I know. The last document in this packet is a codicil to
      my original will, which I am assured will be legally binding. In it I
      have made provision for a response to these changes.</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Anxious to discover what was meant by this unexpected final word
    from the writer, the curator tried to separate the bottom paper from those
    above it but, frustratingly, it refused to budge. So, slowly and
    painstakingly, beginning at the top of the pile, the documents were
    separated one by one then laid out in strict order across the table so
    that the gathering might at least look upon them. The final two documents
    proved to be stuck together by the seal affixed to the bottom one. The
    assembled pile must have been placed on top of her will codicil before the
    wax of its seal had completely set. Once more, the warmed knife was
    patiently applied to the separation of the two documents. Then, just as
    the knife was about to be applied to the removal of the seal from the will
    codicil there was a distraction in the form of a discrete cough nearby.
    Looking up, the curator came face to stony face with the Bisdom van Vliet
    trust's lawyer.</para>

    <para><quote>I think that we should observe the same procedure as is usual
    for the reading of a will. It is my view, also, that the appropriate legal
    experts should be consulted in order to make a determination as to whether
    this additional document is, indeed, legally valid. We need to be sure of
    our position before we announce Weduwe Bisdom van Vliet's final wish to
    the public.</quote></para>

    <para>The curator knew that the lawyer was right despite her frustration
    at the anti-climax of having so nearly exposed this last, unanticipated
    mystery. With reluctance, the sealed document was yielded up to the
    lawyer's outstretched hand with a request that the he set about making the
    necessary arrangements as soon as possible. For the time being, all that
    remained was to supervise the museum's guests as they filed past the table
    to view the materials laid out upon it and made their way out of the
    building. After what seemed like an eternity, the curator was alone in the
    house. A decade had passed since her appointment as curator of the museum
    that was the widow's legacy to the people of Haastrecht. Intimacy seemed
    to have grown between the two women over time and, as she picked up the
    first of the letters and began to read ...</para>
