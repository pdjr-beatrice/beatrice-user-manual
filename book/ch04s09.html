Two 230VAC energy inputs are available: a shore-power connection on the aft deck allows connection to a utility outlet and supplies energy to the inverter-charger through a 7kW isolating transformer; the ship's generator can provide up to 12kW of energy when off-grid.</p><p>The solar charge controller connects to a 1kW solar panel array mounted over the aft deck.</p><p>The main DC connection box integrates all suppliers and consumers</p><p>are of can be switched between charge only and inverter-charge only energised when the the ship is connected to a 230VAC shore power supply or when the ship's generator is running.</p><p>A direct connection from the battery isolator switch powers Busbar 1 which supports connection of services which should be permanently available even when the boat is out of service. This includes connections to charging sources (charger/inverter, main engine alternator and solar charge controller) and some safety critical consumers (helm-panel essential services like bilge pumps and alarms and spudpole). Individual isolators can be operated to disconnect these consumers if required.</p><p>A second connection from the battery isolator switch goes via an isolator to Busbar 2 which supports connection of all non-essential consumers.
