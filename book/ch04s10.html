For example, if the demand is solely for hot water, then a fully charged buffer may continue to satisfy this demand for up to 48h with no intervention and indefinitely with occasional, low-level, energy input. Equally, if there is a demand for space heating throughout the boat, then the diesel boiler might be the obvious recharge source although availability of shore power and a low or zero space heating demand might make immersion heating a suitable alternative. For a vessel navigating norther Europe in the summer it is unlikely that any additional heat input to the buffer will be necessary over and above that supplied by the main engine.</p><p>The domestic panel controls which operate the buffer are:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>IMMERSION 1kW</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Operates the 1kW immersion heater which is the located towards the top of the thermal buffer and can effectively prepare the system for hot water generation only.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>IMMERSION 2kW</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Operates the 2kW immersion heater which is located further down the the thermal buffer and can quickly prepare the system for hot water generation only.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>IMMERSION 1kW</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>IMMERSION 2kW</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Running both immersion heaters simultaneously will rapidly prepare the buffer for hot water generation and can also support low demand space heating.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>BOILER</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Recharging the buffer using the boiler supports immediate hot water generation (even when the store is at ambient temperature) and continuous high-load heating demands.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3166"></a>10.2.&nbsp;Domestic hot water</h3></div></div></div><p>Domestic hot water is available any time the thermal buffer is charged.</p><p>A fully charged buffer can support up to 48 hours of solely domestic hot water demand before requiring a recharge.
