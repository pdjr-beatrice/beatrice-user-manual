  <title>Ethernet LAN</title>

  <para>Ethernet LANs support a range of ship services, providing client access for information displays,
  virtual control panels, VoIP deck communication, map and NIS services and audio and video entrtainment.
  The general arrangement of LAN components is illustrated in the following schematic.</para>

  <para>A power over Ethernet POE Switch establishes a wired Ethernet LAN that connects important
  servers, desktops and installed equipment like IP cameras. Devices in this network are assigned
  static IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net.</para>

  <para>This basic LAN is sufficient to provide a platform for operating the ship, but normally
  it will be extended by one or more wireless mesh networks created by Helm Router and
  Saloon Access Point. A wireless network with SSID “beatrice” uses the same 192.168.1.0/24
  sub-net as the wired LAN and clients have unrestricted access to all on-board services.
  A second wireless network “beatrice-guest” uses a different sub-net with restricted bandwidth
  and limited access to devices on the primary LAN. Client devices on the mesh networks are
  assigned IP addresses by Helm Router‘s DHCP service with some clients (for example the ship’s
  audio visual devices) receiving fixed addresses.</para>

  <para>Helm Router‘s WAN interface can be connected through A/B Switch to either WiFi Router or
  4G Router facilitating access to the Internet for the whole network. Internet access via WiFi
  Router is only feasible when the vessel has access to a suitable shore-based WiFi access point;
  when the vessel is cruising the only viable means of Internet access will be via 4G Router
  which, in an case, seeks to maintain a permanent cellular data connection.</para>

  <para>Typically, all the various network routers, switches and access points should be powered
  whenever the vessel is in commission.</para>

  <para>User operation of the LAN reduces to selecting the WAN connection type (A/B Switch can
  be remotely operated by the helm panel [WiFi] switch) and visiting WiFi Router‘s configuration
  interface in order to establish a connection to a harbour access point. The mesh network is
  implemented on Google WiFi hardware and can be monitored and configured using the “Google Home” App.</para>

  <para>See this table for an inventory of (and more detailed information on) LAN devices which
  have static and fixed IP addresses.</para>
