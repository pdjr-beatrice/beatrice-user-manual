  <para>A power over Ethernet POE Switch establishes a wired Ethernet LAN that connects important servers, desktops and installed equipment like IP cameras. Devices in this network are assigned static IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net.</para>

  <para>This basic LAN is sufficient to provide a platform for operating the ship, but normally it will be extended by one or more wireless mesh networks created by Helm Router and Saloon Access Point. A wireless network with SSID “beatrice” uses the same 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net as the wired LAN and clients have unrestricted access to all on-board services. A second wireless network “beatrice-guest” uses a different sub-net with restricted bandwidth and limited access to devices on the primary LAN. Client devices on the mesh networks are assigned IP addresses by Helm Router‘s DHCP service with some clients (for example the ship’s audio visual devices) receiving fixed addresses.</para>

  <para>Helm Router‘s WAN interface can be connected through A/B Switch to either WiFi Router or 4G Router facilitating access to the Internet for the whole network. Internet access via WiFi Router is only feasible when the vessel has access to a suitable shore-based WiFi access point; when the vessel is cruising the only viable means of Internet access will be via 4G Router which, in an case, seeks to maintain a permanent cellular data connection.</para>
