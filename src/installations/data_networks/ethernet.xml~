  <title>Data networks</title>

  <para>NMEA 2000 and Ethernet data networks are installed on the ship
  together with some small-scale proprietary networks concerned with operation
  of the Victron power system.</para>

  <section>
    <title>NMEA 2000</title>

    <para>WCs pump macerated waste directly to the holding tank each time the
    'flush' function is activated.</para>

    <para>The WCs operate at 230VAC and are supplied via circuit-breakers in
    distribution cabinets C1 and C4. The WCs should normally remain powered
    whenever the vessel is in use.</para>

    <title>Ethernet</title>

    <para>Ethernet is used to support general access to ship services
    including analytics and virtual control panels, VoIP deck communication,
    map and NIS services and audio and video entrtainment. The following
    schematic indicates the general structure.</para>

      <title>Wired networks</title>

      <para>Ethernet cabling from around the ship terminates at a newtwork
      switch located in the ship's data cabinet which is accessible behind a
      panel on the port side of the lower companionway. The switch itself is
      connected by a single cable to the main router located at the helm. Helm
      equipment which benefits from an Ethernet connection is cabled directly
      to the main router's built in LAN switch.</para>

      <para>A second wired network consisting of a single cable connects the
      main router's WAN port to the ship's external gateway.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Wireless networks</title>

      <para>The ship implements two WiFi networks: an internal network
      (SSID="BEATRICE") simply extends the vessels 192.168.1.0 network whilst
      and external network (SSID="BEATRICE-EXT") supports VoIP intercom use
      for deck crew and allows restricted access to on-board services for
      guests.</para>
