  <title>Space heating, cooling and hot water</title>

  <para>The vessel is equipped with an integrated hydronic space heating and
  cooling system (SHCS) (see <xref
  linkend="heating-system-overview"/>).</para>

  <para>SHCS is bi-modal: at any one time the system can be in either heating
  mode or cooling mode - determining whether a heat source or heat sink is
  connected to the circulating heat exchange medium. Thus, it is not possible
  to heat one space on the ship whilst simultaneously cooling another.</para>

  <para>The operating mode of SHCS is selected by the <keycap>CHILLER</keycap>
  switch at the domestic panel: when the switch is OFF, the system is in
  heating mode; when it is ON, the system is in cooling mode.<footnote>
      <para>In fact, the ship's central chiller can operate in reverse cycle,
      so it is possible to operate the HVAC system in cooling mode in a way
      which generates space heating.</para>
    </footnote>Domestic hot water is available irrespective of the operating
  mode of SHCS.</para>

  <para>The vessel has a mix of fancoil and radiator heat exchangers:
  radiators only operate in heating mode whilst fancoil units will operate in
  heating mode and cooling mode.</para>

  <para>The primary heat source on the vessel is a large thermal buffer,
  consisting of a well-insulated mass of heated water, and in order for the
  ship to be heated and hot-water to be available, the buffer must be
  maintained at an appropriate operating temperature.</para>

  <para>The primary heat sink on the vessel is a refrigeration unit capable of
  chilling the circulating hydronic fluid and so allowing the fancoil units to
  blow cold air.</para>

    <title>Thermal buffer</title>

    <para>The thermal buffer holds 250 litres of hydronic fluid which acts as
    the heat source for space heating and domestic hot water.<footnote>
        <para>One benefit of using a buffer is that its high heat capacity
        ensures that the diesel boiler runs more efficiently with less cycling
        than would occur if the boiler were directly driving the heating or
        hot water systems; a further benefit is that once heated the buffer
        can produce many times its own volume of domestic hot water.</para>
      </footnote>The thermal buffer is designed to operate at 85C and it can
    be heated (recharged) from the sources shown in the following
    table.</para>

    <para>Typically the hydronic fluid in the thermal buffer rapidly assumes a
    temperature gradient and it will be capable of driving the hot-water
    system and, to a lesser extent, SHCS in less time than would be required
    for a full recharge.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Operating the thermal buffer</title>

      <para>The user can choose how and when to recharge the thermal buffer
      and typicall the choice will be based upon the demand for heat and the
      economy of an available heat source. For example, if the demand is
      solely for hot water, then a fully charged buffer may continue to
      satisfy this demand for up to 48h with no intervention and indefinitely
      with occasional, low-level, energy input. Equally, if there is a demand
      for space heating throughout the boat, then the diesel boiler might be
      the obvious recharge source although availability of shore power and a
      low or zero space heating demand might make immersion heating a suitable
      alternative. For a vessel navigating norther Europe in the summer it is
      unlikely that any additional heat input to the buffer will be necessary
      over and above that supplied by the main engine.</para>

    <title>Domestic hot water</title>

    <para>Domestic hot water is available any time the thermal buffer is
    charged.</para>

    <para>A fully charged buffer can support up to 48 hours of solely domestic
    hot water demand before requiring a recharge. If the domestic panel
    <keycap>BOILER</keycap> switch is ON, then channel 2 of the four-channel
    time controller located in the galley can be used to schedule or initiate
    an immediate recharge of the thermal buffer.</para>

    <para>Hot water is generated by a plate heat exchanger with its primary
    circuit fed from the thermal buffer and its secondary circuit fed directly
    from the hydrophore. The output of the plate heat exchanger passes through
    a blending valve to give a comfortable domestic hot-water temperature. An
    independent, intelligent, hot-water loop can be used to make hot water
    available instantaneously at each outlet.</para>

      <para>The domestic panel controls which operate the domestic hot water
      system are:</para>

            the pump driving the primary heat exchange circuit is enabled: a
            flow switch will start the pump when a hot water outlet is opened
            or when the hot-water loop is enabled. This control should be left
            in the ON position when the ship is occupied.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Space heating</title>

    <para>Space heating is available any time the thermal buffer is charged,
    but the demands of heating the entire ship will rapidly deplete the buffer
    if one or more means of continuous recharge is not available.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Operating the heating system</title>

      <para>The heating system will only be available if the domestic panel
      <keycap>CHILLER</keycap> control is OFF.</para>

      <para>The heating system circulation pump is operated by channel 1 of
      the four-channel time controller located in the galley. If the heating
      demand is high and neither the generator or main engine are running,
      then the thermal store should be configured for recharge from the diesel
      boiler by setting the domestic panel <keycap>BOILER</keycap> switch to
      ON. If the heating demand is low and shore or generator power is
      available, then using both immersion heaters to recharge the store is
      feasible.</para>
