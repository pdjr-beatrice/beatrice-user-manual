  <title>Deck wash</title>

  <para>The ship's deck wash system serves auto-stop bayonet-style hose
  connector outlets located on the aft-deck and fore-deck.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Forward deck wash outlet</title>

    <para>The forward deck wash outlet is supplied with fresh water from the
    ship's pressurised domestic water system.</para>

    <para>The outlet and it's associated above-deck pipework can be isolated
    and drained via a combined stop/drain cock located behind an access panel
    at the back of the master cabin hanging locker.</para>

    <title>Aft deck wash outlet</title>

    <para>The aft deck wash outlet can be configured to supply either fresh
    water from the ship's pressurised domestic water system or raw water from
    the environment.</para>

    <para>The outlet and it's associated above-deck pipework can be isolated
    and drained via a combined stop/drain cock located on the engine room deck
    head just aft of the engine room hatch.</para>

      <title>Changing the supplied water type</title>

      <para>The source of water for the aft deck wash outlet is changed by
      opening and closing two valves in the engine room: The fresh water
      shut-off valve is located on the deck head just aft of the engine room
      hatch; the raw water pump isolating valve is located on the chiller unit
      raw-water intake manifold.</para>

        </inlinemediaobject>Ensure that fresh water shut-off valve is kept
      closed when the raw water pump is in use. An automatic double-check
      valve provides passive protection against cross-contamination of the
      fresh water system with raw water, but it is best not to rely on this as
      the sole means of system isolation.</para>
