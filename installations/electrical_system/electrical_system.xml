    <title>Domestic 230VAC system</title>

    <para>The ship's 230VAC system supports most domestic consumer functions
    including hydrophore, heating, cooling, ventilation, galley refrigeration,
    interior lighting, WC and waste sumps. The supply-side of the system is
    controlled by an integrated charger-inverter monitored and operated from
    the domestic panel.</para>

    <para>All outgoing circuits are routed through the main distribution
    cabinet C1 to a collection (C2, C4, C5a and C5b) of sub-cabinets which
    feed individual consumer circuits. All circuits are fused by circuit
    breaker and single-pole residual current protection.</para>

    <para>Residual current safety features are only functional if the
    shore-power connection is properly polarised.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Energy sources</title>

      <para>The following table lists available energy sources. The ship's
      systems are configured to automatically select the energy source with
      the lowest priority number when it is available. The charger/inverter is
      able to concurrently top-up any shortfall in generator or shore supply
      by inversion.</para>

        <title>Distribution cabinet C1</title>

        <para>Distribution cabinet C1 is the upper of the two cabinets
        installed in the forward bulkhead of the lower deck lobby and is the
        ship's main AC distribution cabinet.</para>

        <para>The cabinet receives two 230VAC supplies directly from the
        ship's inverter/charger. A no-break supply (via isolator (1)) feeds
        all of the cabinet devices, deriving power from the currently selected
        source. A second supply (via isolator (6)) derives power from shore
        and generator only and routes this directly to cabinet C5a since the
        only consumers of this supply are located in the ship's engine
        room.</para>

        <para>All circuits in the cabinet are overload and leakage protected.
        Four RCBO devices at the top-right of the cabinet supply individual
        circuits making these consumers insensitive to failures in other
        circuits and to nuisance tripping. Four outgoing circuits (protected
        by (2)) supply downstream distribution cabinets with circuits
        protected by (3), (4) and (5) supplying consumers in the galley and
        lower-deck.</para>

        <para>The cabinet receives a 230VAC supply from cabinet C1 via
        isolator (1).</para>

        <para>All circuits in the cabinet are overload and leakage protected
        and are concerened with lighting control for the aft of the ship,
        operation of the ship's PIR sensors, and heating control. The
        distribution cabinet houses a 12VDC power supply for the ship's PIR
        sensors and a 24VDC power supply for light switch circuits on the
        lower deck. The ship's intruder alarm system is installed in the lower
        half of the cabinet.</para>
